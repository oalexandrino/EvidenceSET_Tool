# EvidenceSET_Tool

Secondary and tertiary studies are broadly applied by researchers from many fields. Researchers use to spend several weeks to analyze each relevant publications to be part of a body of knowledge for a specific research topic.  

Performing a secondary or tertiary study can be an obstacle for some researchers due to a long time frame or high number of selected publications. In order to decrease such efforts, there is the EvidenceSET! 

It is a web-based tool to support the creation of research themes from a set of primary or secondary studies.
